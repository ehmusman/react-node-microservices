one of the biggest challange is tha datamanagement between different services

with microservices we store and access data in sort of strange way. 
1- how we sore data
2- how we access data
in microsrvice approach.

a- we create saperate database for each of different microservice.
b- we are not going to acces data from one service to other microservice's database, 
why this is?

why database per service?
1- we want each service to run indeendently of other services
2- database schema/structure might change unexpectedly
3- some services might function more efficiently with different types of DB's(sql VS noSql)

what? if we have one database for every services?
if some thing bad happens with database all services will be affected badly
scalling this database will be really challanging.
