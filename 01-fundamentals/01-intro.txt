what are microservices?
before we know about it we have to know that how we probably build the servers right now?
we use monolithic archirecture. in monolithis architecture we have all of code of our application under a single code base. and we deploy this code base as a single discrete unit.
in this architecture when we send a request it probably goes through the auth middleware, than go towards the router. through a specificc route and different logic is implemented on the base of requst and that request might get the data from the database and send it to back to the user.
