what are microservices?
before we know about it we have to know that how we probably build the servers right now?
we use monolithic archirecture. in monolithis architecture we have all of code of our application under a single code base. and we deploy this code base as a single discrete unit.
in this architecture when we send a request it probably goes through the auth middleware, than go towards the router. through a specificc route and different logic is implemented on the base of requst and that request might get the data from the database and send it to back to the user.

in short we can say that 
a monolithic contains all the routings, all the midlewares, all the business logic, all database access at the same place to implement all the features of our app.

a single micro service contains all of the routings, all the middlewares, all the businesss logics, database access to implement the one featurs of our application.

so in monolithic all the code is needed to implement every feature of our application and in monolithic code is needed to implement the one feature of our application.

in microservices all different features are wrapped inside the each of different service. the most important thing is that each of the service is entirely self contained.
if any other service crashes it doesnt effect the other service.
